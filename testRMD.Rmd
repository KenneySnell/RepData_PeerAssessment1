## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,fig.width=8, fig.height=6, inlcude =TRUE }
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE,fig.width=8, fig.height=6,inlcude =TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```
