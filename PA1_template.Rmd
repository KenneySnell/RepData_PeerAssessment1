# Working with Activity Data
Kenney Snell

## Introduction

#1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
```{r , echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:\\Users\\app1kms\\Documents\\Training\\2017\\DataScience_Downloads\\Reproducibe_Research\\repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity")
act_df  <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(act_df)
summary(act_df)

```

Process and transform the data
```{r , echo=TRUE}
activity_cpl <- act_df[complete.cases(act_df),]
str(activity_cpl)
summary(activity_cpl)


```
#2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r , echo=TRUE}
histData <-  aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity_cpl, sum)
steps <- histData

```

The total number of steps taken for each day is:

```{r , echo=TRUE}
steps
```


```{r , echo=TRUE}
h <- hist(histData$steps,  # Save histogram as object
          breaks = 11,  # "Suggests" 11 bins for the histogram
          freq = T,
          col = "thistle1", 
          main = "Histogram of Activity",
          xlab = "Number of daily steps")

```

#3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r , echo=TRUE}
Mean_steps <- mean(histData$steps)
Median_steps <- median(histData$steps)
```




The mean  of the toal number of steps per day is `r Mean_steps`.
The median of the toal number of steps per day is  `r Median_steps`.


#4. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)


```{r , echo=TRUE}
histData <-  aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity_cpl, sum)
Median_steps <- median(histData$steps)


PlotData <-  aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity_cpl, mean)



plot(PlotData$steps ~ interval, PlotData, xaxt = "n", type = "l")
axis(1, PlotData$interval,  cex.axis = .7)
```


#5. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r , echo=TRUE}
maxSteps = max(PlotData$steps)
library(dplyr)

Maxinterval <- subset(PlotData, steps==maxSteps,select=interval)

Maxinterval

```
The max interval is `r Maxinterval`, for a value of `r maxSteps`.

#6.Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

```{r , echo=TRUE}
for (Var in names(act_df)) {
    missing <- sum(is.na(act_df[,Var]))
    if (missing > 0) {
       missing_steps <-  print(c(Var,missing))
    }
}


```

The total number of missing rows is `r missing_steps`.
# 7. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed

Assign the mean of that interval for missing values

```{r , echo=TRUE}
MeanData <-  aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity_cpl, mean)

# new Data Frame
act_df2 <- act_df

for (i in as.numeric(1: nrow(act_df))) {
    
    if(is.na(act_df[i,1]))  {
   
   
    MeanStep <- subset(MeanData, interval==act_df$interval[i],select=steps)
    
    act_df2[i,1] <- MeanStep

      }
     
    
    }
```


Use the new updated data frame

```{r , echo=TRUE}


histDataNew <-  aggregate(steps ~ date, data = act_df2, sum)
stepsNew <- histDataNew
h <- hist(histDataNew$steps,  # Save histogram as object
          breaks = 11,  # "Suggests" 11 bins for the histogram
          freq = T,
          col = "thistle1", 
          main = "Histogram of Activity",
          xlab = "Number of daily steps")

```

Calculate the NEW mean and median
```{r , echo=TRUE}
Mean_stepsNew <- mean(histDataNew$steps)
Median_stepsNew <- median(histDataNew$steps)
```


The NEW mean  of the toal number of steps per day is `r Mean_stepsNew`.
The NEW median of the toal number of steps per day is  `r Median_stepsNew`.


The ORIGINAL mean  of the toal number of steps per day is `r Mean_steps`.
The ORIGINAL median of the toal number of steps per day is  `r Median_steps`.

Result are that the mean didn't vhange becuase of using the overal mean of each interval.
But the median was slightly less.


# 8. Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

a. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r , echo=TRUE}
act_df2$weekday <- weekdays(as.Date(act_df2$date))
act_df2$date <- as.Date(act_df2$date)
weekdays1 <- c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')

#Use `%in%` and `weekdays` to create a logical vector
#convert to `factor` and specify the `levels/labels`

act_df2$wday <- factor((weekdays(act_df2$date) %in% weekdays1), 
         levels=c(FALSE, TRUE), labels=c('weekend', 'weekday')
)
act_df2
```


New plot for Weekday and weekend


```{r timeplot2, echo=TRUE, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
 # create table with steps per time across weekdaydays or weekend days
 StepsPerTimeDT <- aggregate(steps~interval+wday,data=act_df2,FUN=mean,na.action=na.omit)
 # variable time (more comprensible for the graph axis)
 
 # draw the line plot
library(ggplot2)
 j <- ggplot(StepsPerTimeDT, aes(interval, steps))
 j+geom_line(col="blue")+ggtitle("Average steps per 5 minute interval: weekdays vs. weekends")+xlab("Interval")+ylab("Steps")+theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=12))+facet_grid(wday ~ .)
 ```
